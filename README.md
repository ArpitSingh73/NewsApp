# R-News

This is a news app (Webapp) build on React. I have used 'NewsAPI' for fetching the news. However, I could not deploy the app, as the API is not free for production environment. In case you want to use it, feel free to fork the project, use your own API key & you are good to go. This project allowed me to learn and implement :-
API fetching ☑
Displaying the data in app from API response ☑
ReactJs ☑
JavaScript ☑
Bootstrap☑
etc.
